Title: 
- Don't let the ball bounce into the water
----------
Description of Project: 
- Simulates earth's gravity on a basketball and allows sideways navigation of the ball to make it from one 
  side of the river to the other.
----------
Team Members: 
- Me

110 Programming Concepts Used (what, how, and why?):
- Pixi Js: GUI library that provides tools to make coding GUI's in typescript easier.
- GUI: Graphical User Interface.
- Inheritance: Something being inside something else. Used when I added the background to the stage.
- Setting up an HTML file: Creating an HTML file to set up a canvas in the browser and link the typescript code so it displays the content.
- Classes: Creating a type of something that has certain properties and methods. I created a ball object to keep track of its movement.
- Constructors: Used to initialize the Ball objects relationship with a sprite.
- Functions: Carry out tasks, can take in values for processing and return values. I used functions to carry out all the actions in the game.
- Value types: String, number and boolean.
- Reference types: Objects (ball).
- If, else statements: I used these to determine where my ball fell into the water, where it should bounce and any other actions conditional on other factors.
----------
Challenges Overcome / New Concepts Learned:
- Making the ball bounce as if it were real was extremely difficult. In the end I managed to find a solution, however, this solution only works for the current
  acceleration. If I were to change the acceleration, the ball might change its position in such a way as to fall through the ground before a collisio can be detected.
- Orienting the sprites. I had no internet over thanksgiving and therefore couldn't look up what the scaling is because a sprites 'x' value seems to be measured differently
  to its 'scale.x' value.
- I learned how to use some of the features of 'pixi js' such as sprites and the ticker method.

Goals Achieved:
- Made a ball bounce as if it were real.
- Created a simple game
----------
Goals Outstanding / Future Work:
- Make the acceleration of the ball adjustable.
- Create a simulator that allows a user to add shapes and see how they affect the ball's acceleration and rotational velocity
