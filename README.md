Hack 110 Hackathon project (11/27/18)

Bouncing Basketball Game:

My intent with this game was to simulate the effect of gravity on a basketball
while taking into account friction which would eventually result in the stopping
of motion of the ball (balanced forces).


Instructions:

The point of the game is to navigate from the left side of the river 
to the right without touching the water.

Use left and right arrow keys to navigate.
